BeginBackupJob
==============

A WPF/C# GUI which runs ntbackup (the built-in Windows backup utility) in the background.

I used this to help my parents keep regular backups without any fuss!

Features:
- Suggestion is to launch as a scheduled task.
- Requests and waits for an external drive with a specific drive label to be plugged in.
- Then, runs either a normal or differential backup using ntbackup (depending on the backup count, stored in the registry), with a sensible output filename, etc.
- Waits for completion and reports success.
